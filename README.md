## Description

As a developer I wanted to create and application that would generate a team profile webpage for a software engineering company through the command line using Node.js. This application uses the npm Inquirer to prompt a user's input about the employees on the company's team and generates an HTML webpage based on the input.

    - [Link to Files](https://github.com/ckoehler16/team-profile-generator)
2. Next make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
3. Once Node.js is installed, make sure you are in the root of your project and run the command:
    - npm init
4. Answer the prompts to create your package.json file.
5. Next install the 'Inquirer' package by entering the following command:
    - npm install inquirer
6. Once 'Inquirer' is installed please make sure that you add the 'node_modules' folder to your .gitigore file so they will not be tracked.
7. Lastly type the following in the command-line and answer the questions to have a company team profile webpage!
    - node index.js

## Usage

Here is a link to the video showing how the application passes through all the unit tests from the command line, how to invoke the application through the command line by typing 'node index.js', and how to answer the prompts and finish the input to generate an HTML webpage that includes exactly what the user typed. The video then goes on to show you the webpage that is generated and the functionality of the page but clicking on an email address and an engineer's GitHub.
